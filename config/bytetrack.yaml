# ByteTrack Configuration for Dealership Surveillance
# Vision 30: Multi-Object Tracking Implementation

# Tracker type (do not change)
tracker_type: bytetrack

# First association threshold (high-confidence detections)
# Detections with confidence >= track_high_thresh are used in first association
# Higher value = more conservative, only very confident detections
# Range: 0.0-1.0, Default: 0.5
# Lowered to 0.4 to match detection confidence threshold
track_high_thresh: 0.4

# Second association threshold (low-confidence detections)
# Detections with confidence >= track_low_thresh are used in second association
# This helps recover tracks from occlusions and partial detections
# Range: 0.0-1.0, Default: 0.1
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# Threshold to create new track
# Only detections with confidence >= new_track_thresh can start new tracks
# Higher value = fewer false tracks, but may miss real objects
# Range: 0.0-1.0, Default: 0.6
# Lowered to 0.4 to allow tracking of all detected objects
new_track_thresh: 0.4

# Frames to keep track alive without detection (track buffer)
# At 10 FPS, 90 frames = 9 seconds
# Higher value = more tolerance for occlusions, but more memory usage
# Range: >=0, Default: 30
# Increased to 90 to keep tracks stable even if detection misses frames
track_buffer: 90

# IoU threshold for matching tracks to detections
# Higher value = stricter matching (bboxes must overlap more)
# Lower value = more lenient matching (allows more variation)
# Range: 0.0-1.0, Default: 0.8
# Lowered to 0.5 for more stable tracking with less strict matching
match_thresh: 0.5

# Fuse confidence scores with IoU distances before matching
# True = consider both spatial overlap and detection confidence
# False = only use spatial overlap (IoU)
# Default: True
fuse_score: true

# Global motion compensation method
# Helps account for camera movement to improve tracking
# Options: orb, sift, ecc, sparseOptFlow, None
# - orb: Fast, good for slight movement
# - sift: Slower, more accurate
# - ecc: Enhanced correlation coefficient
# - sparseOptFlow: Optical flow, good for camera shake
# - None: No compensation (for static cameras)
# Default: sparseOptFlow
gmc_method: sparseOptFlow

# Re-identification (ReID) settings
# ReID uses appearance features to match tracks across occlusions
# Disabled by default for performance

# Enable ReID (appearance-based matching)
# True = use appearance features (slower but better ID persistence)
# False = use only motion (faster)
# Default: False
with_reid: false

# ReID model to use
# Options: auto, yolo11n-cls.pt, yolo11s-cls.pt, etc.
# - auto: Use native features from detector (fastest)
# - yolo11n-cls.pt: Lightweight classification model
# Default: auto
# model: auto

# Minimum IoU required for valid match with ReID
# Only used when with_reid=true
# Range: 0.0-1.0, Default: 0.8
# proximity_thresh: 0.8

# Minimum appearance similarity required for ReID
# Only used when with_reid=true
# Range: 0.0-1.0, Default: 0.5
# appearance_thresh: 0.5
